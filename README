Subsystems
================================================================================
std            -- "Standard" function replicas, with modifications for
                  efficiency (POSIX functions are also available in the
                  v4.9.4 of gcc).
                  **Tested working**.

v810           -- Miscellaneous V810 support - IRQs, cache, port-based I/O, etc.
                  **Tested working**.

romfont        -- Activates the in-ROM font processing.
                  **Tested working**.

contrlr        -- Handles input ports, including joypads and mouse/mice.
                  **Tested working**.

timer          -- Controls the TIMER functionality.
                  **Tested working**.

vdc            -- Controls the two HuC6270 video chips, also used in the PC-Engine.
                  **Tested working**.

----- PARTIALLY WORKING BUT INCOMPLETE -----

sound          -- Sound PSG support. Similar to the PSG in the PC-Engine.
                  PSG support is tested working. Other support is untested.
                  Only low-level API exists currently.

bkupmem        -- Handles backup memory access
                  Primitive byte-level, memory-based I/O at this time.
                  Proper FAT-based I/O with PC-FXGA compatibilty planned for future.

----- UNDER CONSTRUCTION -----

cd             -- High-level interface to the CD drive.
                  Original was claimed as 'Tested working', but current status
                  is under construction.

king           -- Controls the KING chip, which controls many other peripherals.
                  Basic support exists and backgrounds have been tested working.
                  Under construction.

scsi           -- Interface to the SCSI interface on KING.
                  Original was claimed as 'Tested working', but current status
                  is under construction.

tetsu          -- Controls NEW Tetsukannon, the video controller.
                  Original was claimed as 'Tested working', but current status
                  is under construction.
